# SetMode

Welcome to the repository that demonstrates an advanced and scalable method for managing multiple **windows** and **immersive spaces** in a **visionOS** application, using a unified `setMode` function!

> **Note:** This approach ensures that transitions between different app states are smooth, scalable, and maintainable â€” essential for real-world spatial computing apps.

---

## ðŸš€ What This Project Covers

- **Unified Navigation:** Easily open/close windows and immersive spaces with a single operation.
- **Custom Environment Key:** Introduces a `setMode` environment value available throughout the app.
- **Dynamic Flow Handling:** Supports both simple and complex application flows.
- **Full Support for Spatial Computing:** Manage multiple simultaneous elements if needed.
- **Concurrency Safe:** Designed with Swift 6 concurrency features in mind.

## ðŸ“‹ Setup Overview

1. **Define a Custom Environment Key (`setMode`)**
   - Injects a function to change modes across the entire app.

2. **Static Window and Space Identifiers**
   - Centralized in a `WindowIDs` struct for maintainability.

3. **Mode Enum**
   - Represents all possible app states (windows or immersive spaces).
   - Includes helper computed properties to manage state behavior.

4. **App Scene Injection**
   - Injects `setMode` into every view by wrapping the windows into a `Group`.

5. **Smart setMode Function**
   - Handles opening, closing, and overlapping windows, as well as immersive space transitions.
   - Manages `@State` values such as `mode`, `immersiveSpacePresented`, and `overlappingWindows`.

## ðŸ§© Example Usage

```swift
struct WelcomeView: View {
    @Environment(\.setMode) private var setMode

    var body: some View {
        Button("Go to main screen") {
            Task { await setMode(.mainScreen) }
        }
    }
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Use This?

âœ… **Scalability:** Add whatever new window or immerive space target, just change your algorithm!  
âœ… **Maintainability:** One centralized way to manage window/immersive transitions.  
âœ… **VisionOS Best Practices:** Designed with spatial computing's multi-window nature in mind.  
âœ… **Concurrency Safety:** Designed to also work with Swift 6 strict concurrency.
